# SpaceChase-2D-Infinite-Shooter
 
**SpaceChase** is a 2D action rogue-lite set in a rich sci-fi/fantasy universe, where players control a spaceship flying endlessly forward. The objective is to dodge obstacles and fight off enemies to survive as long as possible. With mechanics for random generation, each gameplay session offers a unique experience.

## Game Features

- **Controls**:  
  - The spaceship flies forward, while the player can move freely on the screen and accelerate using the WASD keys.
- **Combat**:  
  - Intuitive controls for maneuvers and aiming-based shooting, always oriented toward the mouse position.
- **Procedural Generation**:  
  - Random distribution of enemies and obstacles along the path, adding dynamics and unpredictability.
- **AI-Driven Enemies**:  
  - Enemy ships chase the player, orbiting within attack range and avoiding obstacles when necessary.
